Their legs are digigrade. Their bodies are thin and long. Standing 8ft tall on average, their eyes, glowing purple slits. their faces were smooth.

They do have a mouth, however when opened it revealed a set of teeth sharper than any other creature of the modern world. 

## Other Details

There have been reported moments where a Lost One stopped a child from walking into a newly formed rift before the Guardians could get there. Suggesting they care for the lives of either world

They have no spoken language, and instead communicate telepathically by sending unknown glyphs to the one they wish to communicate with, Attempts to translate have proven fruitless. They do appear to understand common languages however and have aided others with attempts to understand their language by nodding, pointing, or shaking their heads.
