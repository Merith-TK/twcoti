# The Main Story 

A great mage, the most skilled mage to ever live in the Realm of Veylak began to work on a project that would allow him to see what not even the gods themselves could, The gods became interested in this man’s work, as well as the demons who sought to find a realm where they could be free of the gods of this one. But everywhere they looked, they could not. So they hoped that if they found a place where the gods could not look, they could be free of them.

In the modern world, a team of skilled scientists worked on a similar project, however, they wanted to find out what happened to cause the big bang, so they wanted to see if there were more universes like theirs, 

Both parties performed their experiments at the same time. By sheer accident, their calculations lead them to observe each other's worlds. At the exact point where the other had theirs created. Causing a massive explosion and a strange phenomenon to occur, a small white hole formed on either side.

The gods of the magical world protected the mage, however, the Modern world researchers were not so lucky. Their fate was worse than death. 
The magic of the other world began to pour into the modern world.
The modern world has not had any form of innate magic in eons, the magic from the otherworld began to poison all it touched, animate life, and inanimate objects alike, changing its properties, mixing both worlds. While also leaving a magical dead zone around the white hole in the magical world, Not even the gods who tried to rewrite time itself could change it.

The researchers who were caught in the initial explosion suffered severe magical poisoning, their bodies becoming altered by the magic, becoming beasts of the magical world, but still kept their minds as their soul was bound to the modern world, they had to live as the magical beasts and horrors they were turned into… dragons. Some researchers managed to learn to control the magic that was coursing through them, able to alter their forms to get closer to what they once were.

After two months of this magical bleeding, it stopped and the magic began to return to the land around the white hole in the magical world. The mages thought that it was over, that the experiment had failed, while the researchers felt the magic left the world around them, however, they still kept their corrupted forms.

Neither world knew what actually happened,
The Modern world believed that the laws of physics in the world they attempted to observe simply corrupted them, while their world tried to fix them, turning them into what they are now
The Magical world assumed there is simply nothing there, 

The city in which the incident had occurred was quarantined due to high levels of an unknown form of radiation, while the mysterious dragons that appeared out of nowhere, appeared unaffected.

After two years people in the modern world began to gain powers, much like the magic of the other world. The governments immediately noticed these people had a high amount of the radiation from the incident and sent them there, concerned this radiation would poison the population. These people were deemed the Vanished, as when they were taken, they simply vanished from all records, as if they never existed, the only record was the photos and memories people had of them, 

The vanish discovered the dragons, who were more than happy to have the company of humans once more after all these years, they revealed who they once were and that they had created a home around the white hole as they grew weak when they strayed far from it. Theorizing that their bodies were tied to the physics of this other world and if they strayed too far, their bodies would break down because of being incompatible with this world. They thought the Vanished how to channel their newfound powers, how to control it so it would not destroy them or others around them. 

The magical world remained unchanged, people erected a temple around the head-sized sphere of raw magical energy. Some people theorized that it could be the birth of a brand new god, one of the other worlds, not just planes of existence, as the mage used a massive amount of magic to create this sphere, and he did not see anything there, so it could be possible that these new worlds were being forged by this god before it revealed itself to this one. Even the gods agreed, several remembered at their time of awakening, they took time to figure out who or what they were before interacting with other gods.

After many years, the rifts began to open, tears in reality between the Modern world and the Magical world

By this time, the Vanished had learned to contain the “radiation” which they now called “Thaumatic Energy” and had discovered its corrupting properties. By then their numbers ranged in the thousands, forming their own government with the Dragons at the top. The dragons were fair to their people. Helping the new Vanished learn to control their powers and personally teaching them what they knew.

Since the Vanished learned to contain the Energy to their new country, the number of new Vanished has severely dropped, from ten a day, to maybe 3 a month and it continues to drop. 

In the magical world, people simply maintained the temple, making sure it remained pristine and ready for when the god revealed itself.

When the first rift tore open between the worlds, it was massive, it was like reality cracked and split open, orbiting the planet of both worlds, the first to pass through was the International Space Station in the modern world, they were able to send wireless data through to the Modern world when they passed through, however, the people on land observing were horrified as they watched the crew of the ISS mutates, changing into creatures they have never seen before the crew members panicked and accidentally destroyed the ISS in orbit of the magical world.

The gods who were involved with the Mage’s experiment immediately noticed the ISS and how the material seemingly absorbed magic into it, being overly saturated to the point where its integrity failed and broke apart. 

The Dragons, being so closely tied to the magic of the other world felt the new source of this energy and left the Vanished to investigate. No one has seen them since they left the Contained Zone. In their wake a rift opened, linking the temple of the Magical World, to where the sphere of energy was in the Modern world. 

More rifts began to open up around the planet and the Temple, nobody dared step through after what happened to the ISS. 

The Mages of the Magical world managed to recover some technology from the remains of the ISS, and artificers figured out how to repair and use it, standing next to a rift they made contact with the Modern world and explained what had happened on their end. And then the scientists of the modern world explained what happened. Together they learned what really happened and figured out how far along this corruption is… it was around 1/5th, and they theorized that at 50% the corruption would be irreversible and they began to work on containing it on either side, successfully slowing it down and buying time. 

The Vanished now serve as guardians, protecting the rifts from either side as they were the only ones who could safely traverse the rifts without becoming corrupted like the ISS, and without dying because of lack of magic in which the bodies of the magical world had grown accustomed to living within abundance. It would be like generations of people being used and evolving around having extremely thick and rich diets of nutrients, and suddenly not having that.
