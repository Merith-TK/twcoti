Thaumatic energy is what the researchers of Eath called the magical energy that poured out of the rifts, 

This energy is near deadly to the modern world as it acts akin to radiation, attaching to everything, soaking in and degrading it.
However there is another issue with this energy when it comes in contact with living creatures, it begins to "corrupt" them,
mutating them into monsterous beasts in all senses of the word. When a human is corrupted, they retain their memories at the bare minimum, 
but most of their higher functions are replaced with the beasts.
