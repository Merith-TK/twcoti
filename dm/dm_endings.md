There are a few possible endings the players can get

## Collapse the rifts as they appear
This requires the party to find a way to close the rifts.
this is how you close them
* Earth: Push all of the Thaumatic Energy that has bled through, back to the otherside
* Altera: Three mages must cast Dispel Magic on the rift, severely weakening it and stopping the flow of magic, and a fourth must cast Wish to close it now that no magic is being actively fed through

## Find the Lost Dragon
Players must learn from the Lost Ones about the Void, and then either

1) Convince The Lost to take them there
2) Perform this very complicated task
    1. Aquire two (2) Bags of Holding
    2. Empty them out by turning them inside out.
    3. Sew the openings together while they are still inside out
    4. Put one Bag of holding on one side of the rift, and the same on the other side 
    5. Push the two bags of holding back to their original shape through the rift

    What this will do, is it will cause the structure of the rift to repair the "cracks" in reality around it, and reshape itself to a cirlcle with a rust like glow on the edges, the surface of the rift will look as if it is a black hole, all light goes in, and none comes out

This new rift, will take the players to the Void, where they must find Dragon if they are to escape it again. 
At this point, The Lost will follow and guide the players to the dragon where they may speak with them. 
The dragon by now, has gone mad as it has seen all of creation and distruction, every single instant in every single reality, even those which were destroyed. It knows how to repair the damage to the worlds, but cant get itself out of the void to do so.
