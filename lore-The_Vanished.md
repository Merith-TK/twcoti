## Origins
  The Vanished are people who have an inherent immunity to Thaumatic Energy, where instead of being corrupted by low to medium doses, they instead gain powers related to who they are at their core. Some do gain mutations, and are able to utilize these mutations as if they have lived with them all their lives

These people were originally tought how to use their powers in a safe, controlled way. Several who were smart enough to put peices together, discovered a way to halt the tides of Thaumatic Energy from flooding the world. And formed The Rift Guardians.


## Rift Guardians
  The Rift Guards are keepers who protect the world from the Energy that flows outside of rifts, They don deep purple robes and speak in a language neither Altera nor the Modern World have heard before. This language was created by the Guardians to keep their conversations and identies a secret. 

  Their main Purpose is to quickly get to any and all newly formed Rifts, and guard them with their lives, keeping the Thaumatic Energy from Altera from leaking over into the Modern world, while preventing Modern Worlders from crossing into Altera where they will eitehr corrupt or die from the shere amount of thaumatic energy.
