## Thaumatic resonance
  This is how well attuned someone is to Alteran magic, 

  * Defaults
    * Modern World
      * 0%
    * Vanished
      * 50%
    * Alterans
      * 100%

These Values can be increased by spending time in areas with high concentrations of Thaumatic Energy, 
  such as Rifts, or areas where a Vanished Sorcerer triggered wild magic accidentally

The Higher someone's Resonance is, the harder it is to gain more 
* Modern World
  * 0%
    * 1d100 divided by 2
  * 25%
    * 1d50 divided by 2
  * 50%
    * 1d25

## Side Effects
  Modern World Dwellers begin to have their body altered when their resonance reaches 32%,
  this can entail suddenly aquiring a Tail, different eyes, scales, skin color. 
  Every attribute of their bodies can be changed to something from the Alteran World

  Vanished do not suffer physical alterations at high resonance, however depending on which direction their 
  resonance has went, they either become more powerful or weaker depending on their level, 
  *It has harder for an Vanished to gain or loose power than Modern People or Alterans*

  Alterans do not gain any bonuses or alterations from high Resonance, instead loose power when at low Resonance
